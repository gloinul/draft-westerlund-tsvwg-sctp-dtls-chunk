This is not a problem for the initial lock-step handshake, alerts, KeyUpdate, and ACKs. It seems to be a major problem for NewSessionTicket, NewConnectionId, RequestConnectionId, and Post-handshake client authentication as the lack of replay protection might significantly affect availability. It seems to me that DTLS 1.3 forgot to update replay protection based on the new post-handshake messages. Let me know if I miss something.\r\n\r\nIt is a bit surprising that DTLS 1.3 published in 2022 allows the application to turn off replay protection at all. This very far from current best practice for security protocols. There are very good reasons why Datagram QUIC mandates replay protection and why TLS 1.3 has several pages discussing security considerations for 0-RTT data, which lacks replay protection. In general, turning off replay protection (even just for application data) might lead to loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, i.e., the whole CIA triad.\r\n\r\nApplications cannot be expected to understand the severe consequences of not having replay protection or understand how to fix it on the application layer. I also don't see any need for turning off replay protection except RFC 6083 which is a bit of a special case, and which turned out to have replay issues.\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/115/materials/slides-115-tsvwg-sctp-auth-security-issues-00\r\n\r\nI would strongly recommend all DTLS 1.3 libraries to completely remove the option to disable replay protection.\r\n\r\nAn easy fix for the post-handshake messages is to \"clarify\" that replay protection must not be turned off for anything else than application data. I you agree I can submit an \u201cerratum\u201d for RFC 9147. But this does not solve the general issue that turning off replay protection would be a major security problem in almost all applications.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJohn Preu\u00df Mattsson\r\n",

This is simple and avoids error cases if keys expires or are removed for the DTLS Chunk. However, are there any security benefits to encrypting them when one can? It will make targeted attacks against the key-managment harder for established associations, the the actual message itself is protected, but identifiable. However, one can never prevent denial in general through packet dropping. Also it makes the key-management sensitive to synchronization issues in case of failures or key-limit expiration requiring fallback behaviors. \r\n\r\nSo the main question is if extra complexities to have different choices and fallback handling is worth the potential limited benefit of encrypting.

So when the server has gotten far along the process to have keys, it will install the created DCI. However, it will not use it for outgoing nor require it to be used, i.e. still accept unprotected traffic. It falls on the client to not enter the Validation state and start that process until it is certain that it self and the server have the DCI in place.

          "body": "@teiclap and I tried to implement the design team direction of attempting to move the downgrade attack prevention that PVALID Chunk was supporting to the security function running in user space above an SCTP stack. We have run into issues which we think are the result of not fully thinking through this direction and would like to discuss it further.\n \nThe main goal of the PVALID mechanism is ensure that all that was negotiated in clear text was all that the sender of the respective side actually offered so no downgrades occurred at this step INIT/INIT-ACK. To be able to do that both sides needs to accurately represent all that was offered when it comes to security parameters and compare that to all that was received on the peer side. The PVALID mechanism need to carry the relevant information of both what was offered and what was received. I think it is here that we didn\u2019t think this through properly what the implications of this is when trying to do this from the user land level. \n \nThe user land process initiating an SCTP association needs to configure the SCTP stack with which security related options it wants to offer. This will result in one or more security related parameter will be included. So here I would note that we existing parameters are DTLS Chunk (with key-management indicators) and possibly also SCTP-AUTH with the chunks/all chunks, random, HMAC Algo. These offered parameters needs to be either parameterized and included in the cookie, or simply the whole set of relevant parameters included in cookie and then encrypted. \n \nThe responder sends back the INIT-ACK with parameter response for what it accepts to use and relevant parameter values. The Init-ACK also contains the state cookie containing the offered info as well as it\u2019s own response of information. As the responder want to remain stateless for this first Init/Init-ACK procedure nothing is stored locally or given to the upper layer. \n \nThe Initiator receives the INIT-ACK and verifies that the SCTP Association and configured security parameters is viable and stores either the parameters or a representation of what it received. Then it sends the Cookie ECHO back to the responder side. Here the information from the  INIT/INIT-ACK could be provided to key-management but it likely makes sense to wait until 5 when the SCTP association enters established.\n \nThe responder side receives the Cookie-ECHO and unpacks the cookie and creates the SCTP Association state and stores the security parameters. On the responder side the SCTP association is now in established state. However, the key-management step is so far not initiated by the responder but by the initiator. The responder sends the Cookie-ACK. Here is the earlies the responder side could provide the relevant information from the INIT and INIT-ACK to the key management.\n \nThe initiator is receiving the Cookie-ACK and goes into established state. As the SCTP Association establishment succeeded the key-management mechanism can be triggered. It will send its DTLS Client Hello. \n \nThe responder receives the DTLS client hell and gives it to the key-management function. Generates the DTLS Server hello and sends that back. At this point it can install DTLS Chunk receive keys, and send keys, but can\u2019t activate them until it has confirmed that the Server Hello has reached the DTLS Client. So technically this could be based on SCTP SACKs, but I think that is complex when it comes to the API function. Thus, one could initiate PVALID here and send an encrypted DTLS Chunk with a PVALID message, thus potentially mixing encrypted and unencrypted SCTP packets, however any retransmission of the Server Hello must be sent unencrypted.\n \nThe initiator receives the Server Hello and can now install both receiver keys and send keys. It now sends the DTLS Client ACK to conclude the DTLS handshake. This can be sent encrypted to my understanding. The initiator side can after having sent this initiate PVALID mechanism. \n \nThe responder receives the DTLS Client ACK (encrypted) and can also verify conclusion of DTLS handshake and also move to send only encrypted at this point. At this stage it can definitely run PVALID process. \n \nLets, now look at what information is needed to perform the PVALID mechanism. For the initiator to generate a PVALID message it needs to have the actual parameter set or a representation of that stored in the key-management user land protocol. Which means that it either can determine what would be sent based on the configuration, or need have an API function to query the SCTP stack to get what was included in the INIT. Then it could send its PVALID message with this information to the responder.\n \nThe responder when receiving the PVALID message needs to compare the included information with was actually received in the INIT message. However, due to the statelessness, it will get this from the Cookie-Echo (4) and thus needs an API function here to extract this information. I will also note that we need to handle the situation that the responder might not know all the parameters that was offered. Thus, it lacks implementation to know what some of these parameters are. Claudio and I concluded that this comparison can be done in two ways. The PVALID Chunk requires the SCTP stack to determine all options it received in the INIT based on its implementation capabilities and mark those down. Then when it receives the PVALID chunk it compared all it could understand, with all that is offered. If anything was offered that the responder implements but didn\u2019t mark as parsed from the INIT we have a potential modification and should abort. Doing this from the user land level generates certain API requirements. It basically means that in a step after (4) the responder key-management side should read up the SCTP stacks interpretation of what was offered in the INIT. It also needs and API function that gives the corresponding list of all that is implemented in this stack. We see moving this information across the SCTP stack boundary up to the key-management as non-trivial and requires generating an information structure that represents all relevant security parameter combinations. \n\nClaudio have an alternative idea that appears to both of us to result in simpler implementation assuming that PVALID remains a chunk. The core of this idea is to have the implementations perform only a byte comparison between what it received in the INIT/INIT-ACK and what is contained in the PVALID Chunk. We think only the Parameters needs to be compared. So the PVALID chunk will contain a full binary representation of the INIT or INIT-ACK parameters depending on direction. That way both sides simply save what it sent, and later sends it in the PVALID Chunk. As this binary byte object is not interpreted, only stored as part of the SCTP association state doing the validation within the SCTP level is simple and straight forward and avoids the need for additional API calls. \n \nThe only potential downside with this is that this will grow the handshake messages, especially the INIT-ACK as that message needs to contain both the parameter response in clear text, as well as both the received parameters from the INIT as well as its response but protected inside the encrypted Cookie. Thus, the INIT-ACK will contain three sets of parameters.\n \nThe design team will discuss this further.",

Just incorporate the information from the SCTP handshake.\n\nHowever, this makes the implementation much more complex. You need another chunk with retransmission stuff, change the state engine, ...\n\nPutting this into the key derivation, we would need to implement\n* a socket option which enforces the drop of unprotected packets\n* the sending and receiving of the protection solution parameter\n* the corresponding socket option for handling them\n* the socket options to provide the traffic and restart keys\n* the sending and receiving of the DTLS chunk\n* the exposure of user messages have been received in a protected way or not\n\nAdd of these seems to be limited functional changes that can be reviewed and tested even with pre-shared keys.",

This is done by the key management procedure and the key management procedure has to ensure that the receive key is not set before the peer has set the corresponding send key.\n\nFor the DTLS handshake, this means doing these operations during the handshake at specific points.\n\n\n> \n> I think this can result in the deadlock situations unless there is a separate call for moving to require all traffic to be encrypted.\n> \n> The failure case which I don't see working is this: 1: A->Z: DTLS CH 2: Z->A: DTLS SH 3: Z: Can derive both keys, only sets READ as 2 needs to be delivered as plain text. If packet loss of part of (2), SACK will be sent as plain text A->Z. 4: A: Derives Read and Write, sets both ( 5: A->Z: P(DTLS ACK) 6: Z: Sets Write key and locks down receiving unencrypted. 7: Z->A: Send P(PVALID message) 8: A: Locks down to only receive protected. 9: A->Z: Send P(PVALID message)\n> \n> There are alternatives of this, but there appear to be cases where at least one side needs to be able to receive protected, but can't guarantee that all will be protected as there might be unprotected SACK chunks requesting restransmission. And until the next message has been received one can't commit to writing secure as it would cause deadlock.\n\n",

The following text was present in draft-westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-handshake but it makes more sense to add it to Chunks instead. Which leads to an additional question if there should be an API function to instruct the DTLS Chunk to always produce a multiple of the set size large DTLS Chunks. \n```\n\nBoth SCTP and DTLS contains mechanisms to padd SCTP payloads, and DTLS\nrecords respectively. If padding of SCTP packets are desired to hide\nactual message sizes it RECOMMEDED to use the SCTP Padding Chunck\n{{RFC4820}} to generate a consistent SCTP payload size. Support of\nthis chunk is only required on the sender side, any SCTP receiver will\nsafely ignore the PAD Chunk. However, if the PAD chunk is not\nsupported DTLS padding MAY be used.\n\nIt needs to be noted that independent if SCTP padding or DTLS padding\nis used the padding is not taken into account by the SCTP congestion\ncontrol. Extensive use of padding has potential for worsen congestion\nsituations as the SCTP association will consume more bandwidth than\nits derived share by the congestion control.\n\nThe use of SCTP PAD chunk is recommened as it at least can enable\nfuture extension or SCTP implementation that account also for the\npadding. Use of DTLS padding hides this packet expansion from SCTP.\n```",

I was thinking if it is possible to store it in the place where the DTLSCiphertext.encrypted_record was stored. This would avoid memory allocations. But I have to figure out how to implement this. However, the resulting chunks in DTLSInnerPlaintext.content needs to be 32-bit aligned. So the address of DTLSInnerPlaintext.content, which is the address of DTLSInnerPlaintext needs to be divisible by 4.\n\nI need to figure out if this \"in place\" decrypt is possible and was wondering how to ensure 32-bit alignment.\nMaybe this is just an implementation issue, maybe we can help by adding some padding somewhere, maybe it is irrelevant. Nothing to address at the moment, but something I need to figure out when implementing it. Therefore, I wanted to make sure I don't forget it.",

Furthermore RFC 8446, and to our understanding OpenSSL, does not mandate rekeying before reaching 2^64 records equaling up to 7^24 blocks, or theoretically even more in the case of very large TLS records [24]. In OpenSSL, compliance to any rekeying limit is left entirely to the application, which is poor security design. We recommend that the CNSA profile mandate that TLS 1.3 implementations enforce a 2^59 block limit [21\u201323]. A compliant implementation should be required to automatically trigger a key update or terminate the connection before the limit is reached, placing the enforcement burden on the protocol implementation, not the application developer. Frequent rekeying with ephemeral asymmetric key exchange, similar to the requirements for SSH and IPsec, and which can be achieved with resumption, should be recommended.\"\n\nhttps://emanjon.github.io/CNSA-comments/2025%20-%20Comments%20on%20CNSA%202.0%20drafts.pdf\n\nMy understanding is that OpenSSL does not even have an \"get Q\" interface. The application has to count the number of bytes it inputs to TLS.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n",

In this document the initial association setup will be always in plain text.

Another section should describe how to send/recv packets before and after setting the client and server keys and enforcing the reception of DTLS chunks only.\r\n\r\nI think the handling of packets is clear and we have a common understanding. I have been contemplating about the handshake for a couple of days and I think we do not have a common understand right now.
