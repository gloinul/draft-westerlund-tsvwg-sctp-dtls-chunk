         Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) DTLS Chunk
                draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a method for adding DTLS Authentication and
   Cryptographic protection to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
   (SCTP).

   The SCTP DTLS chunk defined in this document is intended to enable
   communications privacy for applications that use SCTP as their
   transport protocol and allows applications to communicate in a way
   that is designed to prevent eavesdropping and detect tampering or
   message forgery.

   Applications using SCTP DTLS chunk can use all transport features
   provided by SCTP and its extensions but with some limitations, and in
   the case of Dynamic Address Reconfiguration RFC 5061 requires
   updates.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a DTLS chunk for the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as defined in [RFC9260].

   This specification defines the actual DTLS chunk, how to enable its
   usage, how it interacts with the SCTP association establishment to
   enable endpoint authentication, key-establishment, and key updates.

   The DTLS chunk is designed to enable mutual DTLS based authentication
   of endpoints, data confidentiality, DTLS based data origin
   authentication, data integrity protection, and data replay protection
   for SCTP packets after the SCTP association has been established.  It
   is dependent on a DTLS Management Method that is defined separately
   to achieve all these capabilities.  The DTLS Management Method uses
   an API to provision the SCTP association's DTLS chunk protection with
   key-material to enable and rekey the protection operations.

   Applications using SCTP DTLS chunk can use most transport features
   provided by SCTP and its extensions.  However, there can be some
   limitations or additional requirements for them to function such as
   those noted for SCTP restart Section 3.8 and an actual update of the
   specification of Dynamic Address Reconfiguration [RFC5061], see
   Section 3.7.  Due to DTLS chunk's level of integration as discussed
   in next section it will provide its security functions on all content
   of the SCTP packet, and will thus not impact the potential to utilize
   any SCTP functionalities or extensions that are possible to use
   between two SCTP peers with full security and SCTP association state.

   DTLS is considered version 1.3 as specified in [RFC9147] whereas
   other versions are explicitly not part of this document.

3.  Overview

3.1.  Protocol Overview

   The DTLS chunk can be used for secure and confidential transfer of
   SCTP packets.  This is implemented inside the SCTP protocol.  Once an
   SCTP packet has been received and the SCTP common header has been
   used to identify the SCTP association, the DTLS chunk is processed by
   the Chunk Protection Operator that will perform replay protection,
   decrypt, verify authenticity, and if the DTLS chunk is successfully
   processed provides the protected SCTP chunks for further processing.
   Figure 1 is an example illustrating the DTLS chunk processing in
   regard to SCTP and the Upper Layer Protocol (ULP) using DTLS 1.3 as
   DTLS Management Method.  Here the DTLS Management Method contains
   validation, i.e. using certificates, handshaking, updating policies
   etc.

          Figure 1: DTLS Chunk Layering in Regard to SCTP and ULP

   In the outgoing direction, once the SCTP stack has created the
   unprotected SCTP packet containing control and/or DATA chunks, SCTP
   chunks will be processed by the Chunk Protection Operator to be
   protected.  The result of this computation is a DTLS 1.3 record
   encapsulated in a SCTP chunk which is named the DTLS chunk.

   The Chunk Protection Operator performs protection operations on all
   chunks of an SCTP packet.  Information protection is kept during the
   lifetime of the association and no information is sent unprotected
   except the initial SCTP handshake, any initial key-management
   traffic, the SCTP common header, the SCTP DTLS chunk header, and the
   INIT and INIT-ACK chunks during an SCTP Restart procedure.

   The support of the DTLS chunk and the DTLS Management Method to use
   is negotiated by the peers at the setup of the SCTP association using
   a new parameter.  DTLS Management and application traffic is
   multiplexed using the PPID.  The dedicated PPID 4242 is defined for
   use by DTLS Management Method for DTLS chunk.  The DTLS Management
   Method uses an API to key the Chunk protection operation function.
   Usage of the DTLS 1.3 handshake for initial mutual authentication and
   key establishment as well as periodic re-authentication and rekeying
   with Diffe-Hellman of the DTLS chunk protection is defined in
   separate documents, (see Section 3.3).  To prevent downgrade attacks
   of the key-management negotiation the DTLS Management Method should
   implement specific procedures when deriving keys.

   When the endpoint authentication and key establishment has been
   completed, the association is considered to be secured and the ULP is
   informed about that.  From this time on it's possible for the ULPs to
   exchange data securely with its peer.

   A DTLS chunk will never be retransmitted, retransmission is
   implemented by SCTP endpoint at chunk level as specified in
   [RFC9260].  DTLS replay protection will be used to suppress
   duplicated DTLS chunks.

3.2.  DTLS Considerations

   The DTLS Chunk architecture splits DTLS 1.3 as shown in Figure 1,
   where the DTLS Management Method is done at DTLS 1.3 block level,
   acting as a parallel User Level Protocol and a Chunk Protection
   Operator functionality inside the SCTP Protocol Stack.

   DTLS Management Method is the set of data and procedures that take
   care of key distribution, verification, and update, DTLS connection
   setup, update and maintenance.

   Chunk Protection Operator functionality is the set of data and
   procedures taking care of User Data encryption into DTLS Record and
   DTLS record decryption into User Data.

   DTLS 1.3 operations requires to directly handshake messages with the
   remote peer for connection setup and other features, this kind of
   handshake is part of the DTLS Management Method.  DTLS Management
   Method achieves these features behaving as a user of the SCTP
   association.  DTLS Management Method sends and receives its own data
   via the SCTP User Level interface.  DTLS Management Method's own data
   are distinguished from any other data by means of a dedicated PPID
   using the value 4242 (see Table 9).

   Once DTLS Management Method has established a DTLS 1.3 connection, it
   can derive primary and restart keys and set the Chunk Protection
   Operator for SCTP Packet Payload encryption/decryption via an API to
   create the necessary DTLS key contexts.  Both a DTLS Key context for
   normal use (primary) and a DTLS Key context for SCTP association
   restart needs to be created.

   In this document we use the terms DTLS Key context for indicating a
   Key and IV, produced by the key-management, and all relevant data
   that needs to be provided to the Chunk Protection Operator for DTLS
   encryption and decryption.  DTLS Key context includes Keys and IV for
   sending and receiving, replay window, last used sequence number.
   Each DTLS key context is associated with a three-value tuple
   identifying the context, consisting of SCTP Association, the restart
   indicator, and the DTLS epoch.

   The DTLS Connection ID in the DTLS Record layer used in the DTLS
   Chunk MUST NOT be used.

   The first established DTLS key context for any SCTP association MUST
   use epoch=3.  This ensures that the epoch of the DTLS key context
   will normally match the epoch of a DTLS Management Method´s
   connection.

   The Replay window for the DTLS Sequence Number will need to take into
   account that heartbeat (HB) chunks are sent concurrently over all
   paths in multihomed Associations, thus it needs to be large enough to
   accommodate latency differences.

   Endpoints implementing DTLS Chunk MUST support DTLS records
   containing up to 2^14 (16384) bytes of plain text.

3.3.  Considerations about SCTP DTLS Management Methods

   This document specifies the mechanisms for SCTP to be protected with
   DTLS, it doesn't specify how the Key Management works, being limited
   on what the Key Management MUST provide for achieving the protection.
   Even though DTLS1.3 is indicated as protocol for providing Key
   Contexts, different implementations can achieve that and different
   mechanisms may be used for features such as mutual authentication,
   rekeying etc.  The DTLS Management Method may use a number of Key
   Management mechanisms depending on what is being implemented and
   available and/or according to the local policies.  DTLS Management
   Methods are defined in their own specific documents, and needs to be
   registered in the IANA Registry "SCTP DTLS Management Methods" to get
   their own unique identifier.  This document constitutes a requirement
   towards any DTLS Management Method.

   Currently there are two in-band DTLS Management Methods defined, they
   have different properties.  See
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-dtls-chunk-key-management] and
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-DTLS-handshake].

3.4.  SCTP DTLS Chunk Buffering and Flow Control

   DTLS 1.3 operations and SCTP are asynchronous, meaning that the Chunk
   Protection Operator may deliver the decrypted SCTP Payload to the
   SCTP endpoint without respecting the reception order.  It's up to
   SCTP endpoint to reorder the chunks in the reception buffer and to
   take care of the flow control according to what specified in
   [RFC9260].  From SCTP perspective the DTLS chunk processing is part
   of the transport network.

   Even though the above allows the implementors to adopt a
   multithreading design of the Chunk Protection Operators, the actual
   implementation should consider that out-of-order handling of SCTP
   chunks is not desired and may cause false congestion signals and
   trigger retransmissions.

3.5.  PMTU Considerations

   The addition of the DTLS chunk to SCTP reduces the room for payload,
   due to the size of the DTLS chunk header, padding, and the AEAD
   authentication tag.  Thus, the SCTP layer creating the plain text
   payload needs to know about the overhead to adjust its target payload
   size appropriately.

   A path MTU discovery function in SCTP will need to know the actual
   sent and received size of packets for the SCTP packets.  This to
   correctly handle PMTUD probe packets.

   From SCTP perspective, if there is a maximum size of plain text data
   that can be protected by the Chunk Protection Operator that must be
   communicated to SCTP.  As such a limit will limit the PMTU for SCTP
   to the maximum plain text plus DTLS chunk and algorithm overhead plus
   the SCTP common header.

3.6.  Congestion Control Considerations

   The SCTP mechanism for handling congestion control does depend on
   successful data transfer for enlarging or reducing the congestion
   window CWND (see [RFC9260] Section 7.2).

   It may happen that Chunk Protection Operator discards packets due to
   replay protection, or integrity errors depending on network induced
   bit errors or malicious modifications.  As those packets do not
   represent what the peer sent, it is acceptable to ignore them,
   although in-situ modification on the path of a packet resulting in
   discarding due to integrity failure will leave a gap, but has to be
   accepted as part of the path behavior.

   The Chunk Protection Operator will not interfere with the SCTP
   congestion control mechanism, this basically means that from SCTP
   perspective the congestion control is exactly the same as how
   specified in [RFC9260].

3.7.  Dynamic Address Reconfiguration Considerations

   [RFC5061] specifies the support for Dynamic Address Reconfiguration
   in SCTP.  DTLS Chunks has limited support for Dynamic Address
   Reconfiguration and requires an update of [RFC5061].  Section 4.1.1
   of [RFC5061] specifies that ASCONF message are required to be sent
   authenticated with SCTP-AUTH [RFC4895].  For SCTP associations using
   DTLS Chunk this would result in the use of redundant and non-
   compatible mechanisms for Authentication with both SCTP-AUTH and the
   DTLS Chunk.

3.7.1.  Limitations

   Support for Dynamic Address Reconfiguration [RFC5061] in an SCTP
   association using DTLS Chunk is limited to the case where the packet
   containing the ASCONF chunk is sent from an IP address already known.

3.7.2.  Change

   Because SCTP-AUTH and DTLS chunks provide non-compatible
   authentication mechanisms, SCTP-AUTH [RFC4895] MUST NOT be used once
   DTLS chunks have been successfully negotiated.

3.8.  SCTP Restart Considerations

   This section deals with the handling of an unexpected INIT chunk
   during an Association lifetime as described in Section 5.2 of
   [RFC9260] with the purpose of achieving a Restart of the current
   Association, thus implementing SCTP Restart.

   This specification doesn't support SCTP Restart as described in
   [RFC9260] because the COOCKIE-ECHO and COOKIE-ACK chunks are sent
   encrypted (see Section 3.8.1);

   When the upper layer protocols require support of SCTP Restart, as in
   case of 3GPP NG-C protocol [ETSI-TS-38.413], the endpoint needs to
   support also initiating protected SCTP Restart procedure described in
   Section 3.8.1.  Implementing initiating protected restart procedure
   is RECOMMENDED, however not required as persistent secure storage of
   the restart DTLS Key Context is needed.

   The cases where one of the SCTP Endpoints only implements initiating
   legacy SCTP Restart are described in Section 3.8.2.

3.8.1.  Protected SCTP Restart

   The protected SCTP Restart procedure keeps the security
   characteristics of an SCTP Association using DTLS Chunk.

   In protected SCTP Restart, INIT and INIT-ACK chunks are sent strictly
   according to [RFC9260], but COOCKIE-ECHO and COOKIE-ACK chunks are
   encrypted using DTLS Chunks and Restart DTLS Key contexts.

   In order to support protected SCTP Restart, the SCTP Endpoints needs
   to allocate and maintain dedicated Restart DTLS Key contexts, SCTP
   packets protected by these contexts will be identified in the DTLS
   chunk with the R (Restart) bit set (see Section 5.1).  Both SCTP
   Endpoints needs to ensure that Restart DTLS key contexts is preserved
   for supporting the protected SCTP Restart use case.

   In order for the protected SCTP endpoint to be available for
   protected SCTP Restart purposes, the DTLS chunk needs access to a
   DTLS Key context for this SCTP association that needs to be kept in a
   well-known state so that both SCTP Endpoints are aware of the DTLS
   sequence numbers and replay window, i.e. initialized but never used.
   An SCTP Endpoint MUST NEVER use the SCTP Restart DTLS Key for any
   other use case than SCTP association restart.

   An SCTP endpoint wanting to be able to initiate a protected SCTP
   restart needs to store securely and persistently the restart Keys,
   and related DTLS epoch, indexed so that when performing a restart
   with the peer node it had a protected SCTP association which can
   identify the right restart Key and DTLS epoch and initialize the
   restart DTLS Key Context for when restarting the SCTP association.
   The keys and epoch needs to be stored secure and persistently so that
   they survive the events that are causing protected SCTP Restart
   procedure to be used, for instance a crash of the SCTP stack.  The
   security considerations for persistent secure storage of keying
   materials is further discussed in Section 13.4.

   The SCTP Restart handshakes INIT, INIT-ACK, COOCKIE-ECHO, COOKIE-ACK
   exactly as in legacy SCTP Restart case; INIT, INIT-ACK MUST be sent
   plain as in the legacy, whereas COOCKIE-ECHO, COOKIE-ACK Chunks MUST
   be sent as DTLS chunk protected using the restart DTLS key context.

   A DTLS Chunk using the restart DTLS key context is identified by
   having the R bit (Restart Indicator) set in the DTLS Chunk (see
   Figure 4).  There's exactly one active Restart DTLS Context at a
   time, the newest.  However, a crash at the time having completed the
   key-management exchange but failing to commit the DTLS Key Context to
   persistent secure storage could result in loss of the latest DTLS Key
   Context.  Therefore, the endpoints SHOULD retain the old restart DTLS
   key context until it the key-management confirms the new ones are
   committed to secure storage.  This can for example be ensure that at
   key-changes signals to terminate the old DTLS Key Contexts (including
   the restart) is never sent until the new restart DTLS Key Context has
   been committed to storage.

            Figure 2: Handshake of SCTP Restart for DTLS in SCTP

   The Figure 2 shows how the control chunks being used for SCTP
   Association Restart are transported within DTLS in SCTP.

   The transport of COOCKIE-ECHO, COOCKIE-ACK by means of DTLS chunk
   ensures that the peer requesting the restart has been previously
   validated and the SCTP state machine after having reached ESTABLISHED
   state moves automatically to PROTECTED state.

   A restarted SCTP Association MUST continue to use the Restart DTLS
   Key Context, for User Traffic until a new primary DTLS Key Context
   will be available.  The implementors SHOULD initiate a rekeying as
   soon as possible, and derive the primary and restart keys so that the
   time when no Restart DTLS Key Context is available is kept to a
   minimum.  Note that another restart attempt prior to having created
   new restart DTLS Key context for the new SCTP association will result
   in the endpoints being unable to restart the SCTP association.

   After restart the next primary DTLS key context MUST use epoch=3,
   i.e. the epoch value is reset.  After having derived new primary DTLS
   Key Context the endpoint installs the primary DTLS Key Context first,
   and start using it.  The new restart DTLS Key Context is only
   installed after any old in-flight restart packets will have been
   received.

3.8.2.  Compatibility with Legacy SCTP Restart

   An SCTP Endpoint supporting only legacy SCTP Restart and involved in
   an SCTP Association using DTLS Chunks SHOULD NOT attempt to restart
   the Association.  The effect will be that the restart initiator will
   receive INIT-ACK but then all sent packets with COOCKE-ECHO will be
   dropped until the peer nodes times out the SCTP Association from lack
   of any response from the restarting node.

   An SCTP Endpoint supporting only legacy SCTP Restart and involved in
   an SCTP Association using DTLS Chunks, when receiving an COOCKIE-ECHO
   chunk protected by DTLS chunk as described in Section 3.8.1, thus
   having the R bit (Restart Indicator) set in the DTLS Chunk (see
   Figure 4), will silently discard it.

   Since an SCTP Endpoint supporting only legacy SCTP Restart and
   involved in an SCTP Association using DTLS Chunks cannot use SCTP
   Restart legacy procedure, in case of need to restart the Association
   it SHOULD keep on retrying initiating a new Association until the
   remote SCTP Endpoint have closed the existing Association (i.e. due
   to timeout) and will accept a new one.  As alternative, depending on
   the Use Case and the Upper Layer protocol, it MAY use a different
   SCTP Source port number so that the peer SCTP Endpoint will accept
   the initiation of the new Association while still supervising the old
   one.

4.  New Parameter Type

   This section defines the new parameter type that will be used to
   negotiate the use of the DTLS chunk during association setup, its
   DTLS Management Method and indicate preference in relation to
   different DTLS Management Methods.  Table 1 illustrates the new
   parameter type.

              +================+===========================+
              | Parameter Type | Parameter Name            |
              +================+===========================+
              |         0x8006 | DTLS Management Parameter |
              +----------------+---------------------------+

                   Table 1: New INIT/INIT-ACK Parameter

   Note that the parameter format requires the receiver to ignore the
   parameter and continue processing if the parameter is not understood.
   This is accomplished (as described in [RFC9260], Section 3.2.1.) by
   the use of the upper bits of the parameter type.

4.1.  DTLS Management Parameter

   This parameter is used to the request and acknowledge of support of
   DTLS Chunk during INIT/INIT-ACK handshake and indicate preference
   order among DTLS Management Methods (if supported).

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                    Figure 3: DTLS Management Parameter

   Parameter Type: 16 bits (unsigned integer)
      This value MUST be set to 0x8006.

   Parameter Length: 16 bits (unsigned integer)
      This value holds the length of the parameter, which will be the
      number of DTLS Management Method fields (N) times two plus 4.

   DTLS Management Method fields: one or more 16-bit DTLS Management
   Method Identifiers:
      Each DTLS Management Method Identifier (Section 12.1) is a 16-bit
      unsigned integer value indicating a DTLS Management Method.  DTLS
      Management Methods include both DTLS Chunk based, where a solution
      combines the DTLS chunk with a DTLS Management Method, or non DTLS
      Chunk based DTLS Management Method.  The DTLS Management Methods
      are listed in descending order of preference, i.e. the first
      listed in the parameter is the most preferred and the last the
      least preferred by the sender in the INIT chunk.  In the INIT-ACK
      chunk the endpoint includes all of the offered DTLS Management
      Methods which it supports and lists the selected one first.
      Including its decreasing preference on the additional DTLS
      Management Methods.

   Padding: If the number of included DTLS Management Methods is odd the
   parameter MUST be padded with two zero (0) bytes of padding to make
   the parameter 32-bit aligned.

5.  New Chunk Type

5.1.  DTLS Chunk (DTLS)

   This section defines the new chunk type that will be used to
   transport the DTLS 1.3 record containing protected SCTP payload.
   Table 2 illustrates the new chunk type.

                    +============+===================+
                    | Chunk Type | Chunk Name        |
                    +============+===================+
                    |       0x41 | DTLS Chunk (DTLS) |
                    +------------+-------------------+

                         Table 2: DTLS Chunk Type

   It should be noted that the DTLS chunk format requires the receiver
   stop processing this SCTP packet, discard the unrecognized chunk and
   all further chunks, and report the unrecognized chunk in an ERROR
   chunk using the 'Unrecognized Chunk Type' error cause.  This is
   accomplished (as described in [RFC9260] Section 3.2.) by the use of
   the upper bits of the chunk type.

   The DTLS chunk is used to hold the DTLS 1.3 record with the protected
   payload of a plain text SCTP packet without the SCTP common header.

   As the full DTLS record with the header and sequence number, etc the
   start of the cipher text is likely not 32-bit aligned making in-place
   encryption/decryption impossible in some plattforms.  Therefore, a
   variable number (0-3) of pre-padding bytes with value fixed to zero
   MUST be added in the DTLS chunk payload before the DTLS Record header
   (DTLS Chunk Payload), to ensure the Encrypted Record part of the
   DTLSCiphertext [RFC9147] will start on a 32-bit boundary in relation
   to the start of the DTLS Chunk.  The number of these pre-padding
   bytes is indicated in the DTLS Chunk header using the P bits.

                       Figure 4: DTLS Chunk Structure

   reserved: 5 bits  Reserved bits for future use.  Sender MUST set
      these bits to 0 and MUST be ignored on reception.

   R: 1 bit (boolean)  Restart indicator.  If this bit is set this DTLS
      chunk is protected with by a Restart DTLS Key context.

   P: 2 bit (unsigned integer 0-3)  Payload Pre-Padding indicator.  It
      indicates how many bytes are inserted for padding before the
      DTLSCiphertext.  This allows the encrypted data to be 32 bit
      aligned.

   Chunk Length: 16 bits (unsigned integer)  This value holds the length
      of the Payload in bytes plus 4.

   Pre-Padding: 0, 8, 16, or 24 bits  Based on the Payload Pre-Padding
      Indicator the indicated number of 8-bit bytes of zero values are
      included.

   Payload: variable length  This holds the DTLSCiphertext as specified
      in DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147].

   Post-Padding: 0, 8, 16, or 24 bits  If the length of the Payload is
      not a multiple of 4 bytes, the sender MUST pad the chunk with all
      zero bytes to make the chunk 32-bit aligned.  The Padding MUST NOT
      be longer than 3 bytes and it MUST be ignored by the receiver.

5.2.  Payload formatting in DTLS Chunk

   From section 4 of [RFC9147], the DTLS record header has variable
   length, here reported in Figure 5.

                     struct {
                         opaque unified_hdr[variable];
                         opaque encrypted_record[length];
                     } DTLSCiphertext;

                       Figure 5: DTLS DTLSCiphertext

   As shown above, DTLSCiphertext record is built up with the
   unified_hdr and the encrypted_record, where unified_hdr has variable
   format as defined in the first byte.  The format of unified_hdr is
   depicted in Figure 6.

                      Figure 6: DTLSCiphertext header

   DTLS Chunk requires encrypted_record to be 32 bit aligned as
   specified in Section 5.1.  The size of the header of the
   DTLSCiphertext can be easily computed by reading the first octet.
   The Length field is redundant with the DTLS chunk's length field and
   can be avoided to be used, and multiple DTLS records SHALL NOT be
   part of the DTLS Chunk's payload field.  Examples of preferred
   DTLSCiphertext are shown in Figure 7.

               Figure 7: DTLSCiphertext recommended structure

   Thus the size of the DTLSCiphertext header, using the first octet B,
   is computed as follows:

   size = 1 + (B & 0x08) ? 2 : 1 + (B & 0x04) ? 2 : 0

   In order the encrypted_record to be 32 bit aligned, P bit in the DTLS
   Chunk header are computed as follows:

   P = (4 - (size & 0x03)) & 0x03

6.  Error Handling

   This specification introduces a new set of error causes that are to
   be used when SCTP endpoint detects a faulty condition.  The special
   case is when the error is detected by the DTLS Management Method that
   may provide additional information.

6.1.  DTLS Chunk Protected Association Parameter Missing

   When an initiator SCTP endpoint sends an INIT chunk that doesn't
   contain the DTLS Management Parameter or a supported DTLS Management
   Method towards an SCTP endpoint that only accepts protected
   associations, SCTP will send an ABORT chunk in response to the INIT
   chunk (Section 5.1 of [RFC9260] including the error cause 'Policy Not
   Met' (TBA10) (see Section 12.4 and the DTLS Management Method
   identifiers Section 4.1 in the missing param Information field.  It
   may also include additional parameters representing other supported
   protection mechanisms that are acceptable per endpoint security
   policy.

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

          Figure 8: ERROR Missing Protected Association Parameter

   Note: Cause Length in bytes is equal to following with the number of
   missing parameters as N: 8 + N * 2 according to [RFC9260], section
   3.3.10.2.  Also the Protection Association ID may be present in any
   of the N missing params, no order implied by the example in Figure 8.

6.2.  Error in DTLS Chunk

   A new Error Type is defined for the DTLS Chunk, it's used for any
   error related to the DTLS chunk's protection mechanism described in
   this document and has a structure that allows detailed information to
   be added as extra causes.

   This specification describes some of the causes whilst the key
   establishment specification MAY add further causes.

   When detecting an error, SCTP will send an ABORT chunk containing the
   relevant Error Type and Causes.

   Cause Code: 16 bits (unsigned integer)
      The SCTP Error Chunk Cause Code indicating "Error in Protection"
      is TBA9.

   Cause Length: 16 bits (unsigned integer)
      Is for N extra Causes equal to 4 + N * 2

   Extra Cause: 16 bits (unsigned integer)
      Each Extra Cause indicate an additional piece of information as
      part of the error.  There MAY be zero to as many as can fit in the
      extra cause field in the ERROR Chunk (A maximum of 32764).

   Editor's Note: Please replace TBA9 above with what is assigned by
   IANA.

   Below a number of defined Error Causes (Extra Cause above) are
   defined, additional causes can be registered with IANA following the
   rules in Section 12.4.

6.2.1.  No Common DTLS Management Method

   If the responder to do not support any of the DTLS Management Methods
   offered by the association initiator in the Protection Soluiton
   Parameters Figure 3 SCTP will send an ABORT chunk in response to the
   INIT chunk (Section 5.1 of [RFC9260], including the error cause "No
   Common Protection" (TBA11) (see Section 12.4).

6.3.  Critical Error from DTLS

   The Chunk Protection Operator MAY inform local SCTP endpoint about
   errors.  When an Error in the DTLS 1.3 compromises the protection
   mechanism, the Chunk Protection Operator may stop processing data
   altogether, thus the local SCTP endpoint will not be able to send or
   receive any chunk for the specified Association.  This will cause the
   SCTP Association to be closed by legacy timer-based mechanism.  Since
   the Association protection is compromised no further data will be
   sent and the remote peer will also experience timeout on the
   Association.

6.4.  Non-critical Error in the Protection

   A non-critical error in Chunk Protection Operator means that the
   Chunk Protection Operator is capable of recovering without the need
   of the whole SCTP Association to be re-established.

   From SCTP perspective, a non-critical error will be perceived as a
   temporary problem in the transport and will be handled with
   retransmissions and SACKS according to [RFC9260].

   When the Chunk Protection Operator will experience a non-critical
   error, an ABORT chunk MUST NOT be sent.

7.  Procedures

7.1.  Establishment of a Protected Association

   An SCTP Endpoint acting as initiator willing to create a DTLS 1.3
   chunk protected association sends to the remote peer an INIT chunk
   containing the DTLS 1.3 Chunk Protected Association parameter (see
   Section 4.1) indicating supported and preferred key-management
   solutions (see Figure 3).

   An SCTP Endpoint acting as responder, when receiving an INIT chunk
   with DTLS Management Parameter, will reply with INIT-ACK with its own
   DTLS Management Parameter containing the selected DTLS Management
   Method out of the set of supported ones.  In case there are no common
   set of supported DTLS Management Methods that are accepted by the
   responder, and the endpoints policy require secured association it
   MUST reply with an ABORT chunk, include the error cause "No Common
   Protection" (TBA11) (see Section 12.4).  Otherwise, the responder MAY
   send an INIT-ACK without the DTLS Management Parameter to indicate it
   is willing to create a session without security.

   Additionally, an SCTP Endpoint acting as responder willing to support
   only protected associations considers an INIT chunk not containing
   the DTLS 1.3 Chunk Protected Association parameter or another
   Protection Solution accepted by own security policy solution as an
   error, thus it will reply with an ABORT chunk according to what
   specified in Section 6.1 indicating that for this endpoint mandatory
   DTLS Management Parameter is missing.

   When initiator and responder have agreed on a DTLS Chunk protected
   association and the DTLS Management Method by means of handshaking
   INIT/INIT-ACK the SCTP association establishment continues until it
   has reached the ESTABLISHED state.

   When the SCTP session has been established follow the process defined
   by the selected DTLS Management Method for establishing DTLS Key
   Contexts and installing them.

7.1.1.  Offering Multiple Security Solutions

   An initiator of an SCTP association may want to offer multiple
   different DTLS Management Method for DTLS Chunk or in combination
   with other DTLS Management Methods in addition to DTLS 1.3 chunks for
   the SCTP association.  Multiple DTLS Management Methods offered in
   the INIT chunk will be ordered based on the priority, where the most
   preferred will be in the first position and the least preferred in
   the last.  The INIT-ACK chunk will only contain the chosen DTLS
   Management Method.  Offers with multiple DTLS Management Methods need
   to consider the downgrade attack risks (see Section 13.3).

   The initiator MAY include in its INIT additional DTLS Management
   Methods that are compatible to offer in parallel with DTLS Chunks.
   This may include SCTP-AUTH [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rfc4895-bis].  This will
   result in that a number of different SCTP parameters may be included
   that are not possible to use simultaneously.  Instead the responder
   needs to parse these parameters to figure out which sets of solutions
   that are offered that the implementation support, and apply its
   security policies to select the most appropriate.  For example an
   offer of DTLS Chunks and SCTP-AUTH, could be interpreted as three
   different solutions with different properties, namely DTLS Chunks,
   DTLS/SCTP [RFC6083], and SCTP-AUTH [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rfc4895-bis] only.
   However, here the DTLS Management Parameter can indicate both
   preference and which of the solutions that are preferred.

   The responder selects one security solutions and includes it in the
   response (INIT-ACK).  If DTLS chunks was selected and the DTLS
   Management Method follows the recommendation for down-grade
   prevention the endpoints know that down-grade did not happen.

7.2.  Termination of a Protected Association

   Besides the procedures for terminating an association explained in
   [RFC9260], DTLS 1.3 chunk MUST ask the SCTP endpoint for terminating
   an association when having an internal error or by detecting a
   security violation.  Note that the closure of any DTLS Management
   Method doesn't compromise the capability of sending and receiving
   protected SHUTDOWN-COMPLETE chunks as that capability only relies on
   the Key Context and not on the DTLS Management Method from where it
   has been derived.

7.3.  Considerations on DTLS Management Method

   It is up to the upper layer to manage the keys for the DTLS chunk.
   The meaning of DTLS Management Method is described in Section 3.3.

   The DTLS Management Method SHOULD use a dedicated PPID to ensure that
   the DTLS Management Method related user messages are handled by the
   appropriate layer.

   When performing DTLS Management, the keys for receiving SHOULD be
   installed before the corresponding send keys at the peer.  For
   mitigating downgrade attacks the key derivation MUST include the DTLS
   Management Method Identifiers that were sent and received.

   The communication is only protected after both sides have configured
   the keys for sending and both sides have enforced the protection.

8.  DTLS Chunk Handling

   The DTLS chunk MUST NOT be bundled with any other chunk.  In
   particular, it MUST be the first and only chunk.

                     Figure 11: Protected SCTP Packets

   The diagram shown in Figure 11 describes the structure of a protected
   SCTP packet being sent.  Such packets are built with the SCTP common
   header.  Only one DTLS chunk can be sent in a SCTP packet.

8.1.  Sending of DTLS Chunks

   When the credentials for sending DTLS chunks have been configured by
   the application, all SCTP packets are sent with a DTLS chunk.

   When an SCTP packet needs to be sent, the sequence of chunks is used
   as DTLSInnerPlaintext.content and DTLSInnerPlaintext.type is set to
   application_data.  Then the DTLSCiphertext is computed and used as
   the payload of the DTLS chunk.  Finally the SCTP common header is
   prepended.

   When the DTLS chunk is used, the DTLS chunk header and the overhead
   of DTLS has to be considered to ensure that the final SCTP packet
   does not exceed the PMTU.

8.2.  Receiving of DTLS Chunks

   When an SCTP packet containing a DTLS chunk bundled with any other
   chunk is received, the packet MUST be silently discarded.

   After the application has restricted the SCTP packet handling to
   protected SCTP packets only, a SCTP packet not containing a DTLS
   chunk MUST be silently discarded.

   When processing the payload of the DTLS chunk (i.e. the
   DTLSCiphertext), the Restart flag in addition to the unified_hdr is
   used to find the keys for processing the encrypted_record.

   After the encrypted_record has been verified and decrypted, the
   corresponding chunks (the DTLSInnerPlaintext.content) are processed
   as defined in the corresponding specifications.

9.  Abstract API

   This section describes an abstract API that is needed between a DTLS
   Management Method and the DTLS Chunk.  This is an example API and
   there are alternative implementations.

   This API enables the cryptographical protection operations by setting
   client/server write keys, sequence number keys, and IVs for primary
   and restart DTLS contexts.  The write key is the used by the cipher
   suite for DTLS record protection (Section 5.2 of [RFC8446].  The
   initilization vector (IV) is random material used to XOR with the
   sequence number to create the nonce per Section 5.3 of [RFC8446].
   The sequence number key is used to encrypt the sequence number
   (Section 4.2.3 of [RFC9147]).

9.1.  Cipher Suit Capabilities

   The DTLS Management Method needs to know which cipher suits defined
   for usage with DTLS 1.3 that are supported by the DTLS chunk and its
   protection operations block.  All TLS cipher suit that are defined
   are listed in the TLS cipher suit registry [TLS-CIPHER-SUITS] at IANA
   and are identified by a 2-byte value.  Thus this needs to return a
   list of all supported cipher suits to the higher layer.

9.11.  Configure Replay Protection

   The DTLS replay protection in this usage is expected to be fairly
   robust.  Its depth of handling is related to maximum network path
   reordering that the receiver expects to see during the SCTP
   association.  However as the actual reordering in number of packets
   are a combination of how delayed one packet may be compared to
   another times the actual packet rate this can grow for some
   applications and may need to be tuned.  Thus, having the potential
   for setting this a more suitable value depending on the use case
   should be considered.

   Note this sets this configuration to be used across any DTLS key
   context for a given SCTP Association and primary/restart usages.

   Request : Configure Replay Protection

   Parameters :

   *  SCTP Association

   *  Restart indication

   *  Configuration parameters

   Reply: Replay Protection Configured

   Parameters : true or false

10.  Socket API Considerations

   This section describes how the socket API defined in [RFC6458] needs
   to be extended to provide a way for the application to control the
   usage of the DTLS chunk.

   A 'Socket API Considerations' section is contained in all SCTP-
   related specifications published after [RFC6458] describing an
   extension for which implementations using the socket API as specified
   in [RFC6458] would require some extension of the socket API.  Please
   note that this section is informational only.

   Please also note, that the API described in this section can change
   in a non-backwards compatible way during the evolution of this
   document due to changed functionality or gained experience during the
   implementation.

   A socket API implementation based on [RFC6458] is extended by
   supporting several new IPPROTO_SCTP-level socket options and a new
   flag for recvmsg().

10.1.  SCTP_ASSOC_CHANGE Notification

   When an SCTP_ASSOC_CHANGE notification (specified in Section 6.1.1 of
   [RFC6458]) is delivered indicating a sac_state of SCTP_COMM_UP or
   SCTP_RESTART for an SCTP association where both peers support the
   DTLS chunk, SCTP_ASSOC_SUPPORTS_DTLS should be listed in the sac_info
   field.

10.2.  A New Flag for recvmsg() (MSG_PROTECTED)

   This flag is returned by recvmsg() in msg_flags for all user messages
   for which all DATA chunks where received in protected SCTP packets.
   This also means that if sctp_recvv() is used, MSG_PROTECTED is
   returned in the *flags argument.

10.3.  Functions

10.3.1.  sctp_dtls_nr_cipher_suits()

   sctp_dtls_nr_cipher_suits() returns the number of cypher suits
   supported by the SCTP implementation.

   The function prototype is:

   unsigned int
   sctp_dtls_nr_cipher_suits(void);

   This function can be used in combination with
   sctp_dtls_cipher_suits().

10.3.2.  sctp_dtls_cipher_suits()

   sctp_dtls_cipher_suits() returns the cypher suits supported by the
   SCTP implementation.

   The function prototype is:

   int
   sctp_dtls_cipher_suits(uint8_t cipher_suits[][2], unsigned int n);

   and the arguments are

   cipher_suits:  An array where the supported cypher suits are stored.
      A cypher suit is represented by two uint8_t using the IANA
      assigned values in the TLS cipher suit registry
      [TLS-CIPHER-SUITS].

   n: The number of cipher suits which can be stored in cipher_suits.

   sctp_dtls_cipher_suits returns -1, if n is smaller than the number of
   cipher suites supported by the stack.  If n is equal to or larger
   than the number of cipher suites supported the the SCTP
   implementation, the cipher suits are stored in cipher_suits and the
   number of supported cipher suits is returned.

10.4.  Socket Options

   The following table provides an overview of the IPPROTO_SCTP-level
   socket options defined by this section.

   +------------------------------+------------------------+-----+-----+

                          Table 3: Socket Options

   sctp_opt_info() needs to be extended to support:

   *  SCTP_DTLS_LOCAL_PMIDS,

   *  SCTP_DTLS_REMOTE_PMIDS,

   *  SCTP_DTLS_ENFORCE_PROTECTION,

   *  SCTP_DTLS_REPLAY_WINDOW, and

   *  SCTP_DTLS_STATS.

10.4.1.  Get or Set the Local Protection Method Identifiers
         (SCTP_DTLS_LOCAL_PMIDS)

   This socket option sets the protection method identifiers which will
   be sent to the peer during the handshake.  It can also be used to
   retrieve the protection method identifiers which were sent during the
   handshake.

   The following structure is used as the option_value:

   struct sctp_dtls_pmids {
           sctp_assoc_t sdp_assoc_id;
           uint16_t sdp_nr_pmids;
           uint16_t sdp_pmids[];
   };

   sdp_assoc_id:  This parameter is ignored for one-to-one style
      sockets.  For one-to-many style sockets, this parameter indicates
      upon which SCTP association the caller is performing the action.
      For setsockopt(), only SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC can be used.  For
      getsockopt(), it is an error to use SCTP_{CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC.

   sdp_nr_pmids:  The number of entries in sdp_pmids.

   sdp_pmids:  The protection method identifiers which will be or have
      been sent to the peer in the sequence they were contained in the
      DTLS 1.3 Chunk Protected Association parameter and in host byte
      order.

   This socket option can be used with setsockopt() for SCTP endpoints
   in the SCTP_CLOSED or SCTP_LISTEN state to configure the protection
   method identifiers to be sent.  When used with getsockopt() on an
   SCTP endpoint in the SCTP_LISTEN state, the protection method
   identifiers which will be sent can be retrieved.  If the SCTP
   endpoint is in a state other that SCTP_CLOSED or SCTP_LISTEN, the
   protection method identifiers which have been sent can be retrieved.

10.4.2.  Get the Remote Protection Method Identifiers
         (SCTP_DTLS_REMOTE_PMIDS)

   This socket option reports the protection method identifiers reported
   by the peer during the handshake.

   The following structure is used as the option_value:

   struct sctp_dtls_pmids {
           sctp_assoc_t sdp_assoc_id;
           uint16_t sdp_nr_pmids;
           uint16_t sdp_pmids[];
   };

   sdp_assoc_id:  This parameter is ignored for one-to-one style
      sockets.  For one-to-many style sockets, this parameter indicates
      upon which SCTP association the caller is performing the action.
      It is an error to use SCTP_{FUTURE|CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC.

   sdp_nr_pmids:  The number of entries in sdp_pmids.

   sdp_pmids:  The protection method identifiers reported by the peer in
      the sequence they were contained in the DTLS 1.3 Chunk Protected
      Association parameter and in host byte order.

   This socket option will fail on any SCTP endpoint in state
   SCTP_CLOSED, SCTP_COOKIE_WAIT and SCTP_COOKIE_ECHOED.

10.4.3.  Set Send Keys (SCTP_DTLS_SET_SEND_KEYS)

   Using this socket option allows to add a particular set of keys used
   for sending DTLS chunks.

   The following structure is used as the option_value:

   struct sctp_dtls_keys {
           sctp_assoc_t sdk_assoc_id;
           uint8_t sdk_cipher_suit[2];
           uint8_t sdk_restart;
           uint16_t sdk_key_len;
           uint16_t sdk_iv_len;
           uint16_t sdk_sn_key_len;
           uint32_t sdk_unused; /* if sizeof(sctp_assoc_t) == 4 */
           uint64_t sdk_epoch;
           uint8_t *sdk_key;
           uint8_t *sdk_iv;
           uint8_t *sdk_sn_key;
   };

   socket options is successful, all affected DTLS chunks sent will use
   the specified keys until the keys are changed again by another call
   of this socket option.

10.4.4.  Add Receive Keys (SCTP_DTLS_ADD_RECV_KEYS)

   Using this socket option allows to add a particular set of keys used
   for receiving DTLS chunks.

   struct sctp_dtls_keys {
           sctp_assoc_t sdk_assoc_id;
           uint8_t sdk_cipher_suit[2];
           uint8_t sdk_restart;
           uint16_t sdk_key_len;
           uint16_t sdk_iv_len;

      sockets.  For one-to-many style sockets, this parameter indicates
      upon which SCTP association the caller is performing the action.
      It is an error to use SCTP_{FUTURE|CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC.

   sdk_cipher_suit:  The cipher suit for which the keys are used.

   sdk_restart:  If the value is 0, the regular keys are added, if a
      value different from 0 is used, the restart keys are added.

   sdk_key_len:  The length of the initialization vector specified in
      sdk_key.

   sdk_sn_key: A pointer to the sequence number key.

   This socket option can only be used on SCTP endpoints in states other
   then SCTP_LISTEN, SCTP_COOKIE_WAIT and SCTP_COOKIE_ECHOED.

10.4.5.  Delete Receive Keys (SCTP_DTLS_DEL_RECV_KEYS)

   Using this socket option allows to remove a particular set of keys
   used for receiving DTLS chunks.

   The following structure is used as the option_value:

   struct sctp_dtls_keys_id {
      sctp_assoc_t sdki_assoc_id;
      uint32_t sdki_restart;
      uint64_t sdki_epoch;
   }

   sdki_assoc_id:  This parameter is ignored for one-to-one style
      sockets.  For one-to-many style sockets, this parameter indicates
      upon which SCTP association the caller is performing the action.
      It is an error to use SCTP_{FUTURE|CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC.

   sdki_restart:  If the value is 0, the regular keys are removed, if a
      value different from 0 is used, the restart keys are removed.

   sdki_epoch:  The epoch for which the keys are removed.

   This socket option can only be used on SCTP endpoints in states other
   then SCTP_CLOSED, SCTP_LISTEN, SCTP_COOKIE_WAIT and
   SCTP_COOKIE_ECHOED.

10.4.6.  Set or Get Protection Enforcement
         (SCTP_DTLS_ENFORCE_PROTECTION)

   Enabling this socket option on an SCTP endpoint enforces that
   received SCTP packets are only processed, if they are protected.  All
   received packets with the first chunk not being an INIT chunk, INIT
   ACK chunk, or DTLS chunk will be silently discarded.

   The following structure is used as the option_value:

   struct sctp_assoc_value {
      sctp_assoc_t assoc_id;
      uint32_t assoc_value;
   };

   assoc_id:  This parameter is ignored for one-to-one style sockets.
      For one-to-many style sockets, this parameter indicates upon which
      SCTP association the caller is performing the action.  It is an
      error to use SCTP_{FUTURE|CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC.

   assoc_value: The value 0 represents that the option is off, any other
   value represents that the option is on.

   This socket option is off by default on any SCTP endpoint.  Once
   protection has been enforced by enabling this socket option on an
   SCTP endpoint, it cannot be disabled again.  Whether protection has
   been enforced on an SCTP endpoint can be queried in any state other
   than SCTP_CLOSED.  Protection can be enforced in any state other than
   SCTP_CLOSED, SCTP_COOKIE_WAIT and SCTP_COOKIE_ECHOED.

10.4.7.  Get Statistic Counters (SCTP_DTLS_STATS)

   This socket options allows to get various statistic counters for a
   specific SCTP endpoint.

   The following structure is used as the option_value:

   struct sctp_dtls_stats {
      sctp_assoc_t sds_assoc_id;
      uint32_t sds_dropped_unprotected;
      uint32_t sds_aead_failures;
      uint32_t sds_recv_protected;
      uint32_t sds_sent_protected;
      /* There will be added more fields before the WGLC. */
      /* There might be additional platform specific counters. */
   };

   sds_assoc_id:  This parameter is ignored for one-to-one style
      sockets.  For one-to-many style sockets, this parameter indicates
      upon which SCTP association the caller is performing the action.
      It is an error to use SCTP_{FUTURE|CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC.

   sds_dropped_unprotected:  The number of unprotected packets received
      for this SCTP endpoint after protection was enforced.

   sds_aead_failures:  The number of AEAD failures when processing
      received DTLS chunks.

   sds_recv_protected:  The number of DTLS chunks successfully
      processed.

   sds_sent_protected:  The number of DTLS chunks sent.

10.4.8.  Get or Set the Replay Protection Window Size
         (SCTP_DTLS_REPLAY_WINDOW)

   This socket option can be used to configure the replay protection for
   SCTP endpoints.

   The following structure is used as the option_value:

   struct sctp_assoc_value {
      sctp_assoc_t assoc_id;
      uint32_t assoc_value;
   };

   assoc_id:  This parameter is ignored for one-to-one style sockets.
      For one-to-many style sockets, this parameter indicates upon which
      SCTP association the caller is performing the action.  It is an
      error to use SCTP_{CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC.

   assoc_value: The maximum number of DTLS chunks in the replay
   protection window.

11.  Implementation Considerations

11.1.  Privacy Padding of SCTP Packets

   To reduce the potential information leakage from packet size
   variations one may select to pad the SCTP Packets to uniform packet
   sizes.  This size may be either the maximum used, or in block sized
   increments.  However, the padding needs to be done inside of the
   encryption envelope.

   Both SCTP and DTLS contains mechanisms to pad SCTP payloads, and DTLS
   records respectively.  If padding of SCTP packets are desired to hide
   actual message sizes it RECOMMEDED to use the SCTP Padding Chunk
   [RFC4820] to generate a consistent SCTP payload size.  Support of
   this chunk is only required on the sender side, any SCTP receiver
   will safely ignore the PAD Chunk.  However, if the PAD chunk is not
   supported DTLS padding MAY be used.

   It needs to be noted that independent if SCTP padding or DTLS padding
   is used the padding is not taken into account by the SCTP congestion
   control.  Extensive use of padding has potential for worsen
   congestion situations as the SCTP association will consume more
   bandwidth than its derived share by the congestion control.

   The use of SCTP PAD chunk is recommended as it at least can enable
   future extension or SCTP implementation that account also for the
   padding.  Use of DTLS padding hides this packet expansion from SCTP.

12.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two new registries in the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Parameters group that IANA maintains.
   Theses registries are for the extra cause codes for protection
   related errors.  It also adds registry entries into several other
   registries in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
   Parameters group:

   *  One new SCTP Chunk Types

   *  One new SCTP Chunk Parameter Type

   *  Three new SCTP Error Cause Code

   And finally the update of one registered SCTP Payload Protocol
   Identifier.

12.1.  DTLS Management Method Identifiers

   IANA is requested to create a new registry called "DTLS Management
   Method".  This registry is part of the of the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Parameters grouping.

   The purpose of this registry is to assign DTLS Management Method
   Identifier for any DTLS Management Method that is either the DTLS
   Chunk combined with a DTLS Management Method, offered as an
   alternative to DTLS chunk.  Any DTLS Management Method that is
   offered through a parameter exchange during the SCTP handshake are
   potential to be included here.

   Each entry will be assigned a 16-bit unsigned integer value from the
   suitable range.

        Table 9: Protection Operator Protocol Identifier Registered

13.  Security Considerations

   All the security and privacy considerations of the security protocol
   used as the Chunk Protection Operator applies.

   DTLS replay protection MUST NOT be turned off.

13.1.  Privacy Considerations

   Use of the SCTP DTLS chunk provides privacy to SCTP by protecting
   user data and much of the SCTP control signaling.  The SCTP
   association is identifiable based on the 5-tuple where the
   destination IP and port are fixed for each direction.  Advanced
   privacy features such as sequence number encryption might therefore
   have limited effect.

13.2.  AEAD Limit Considerations

   Section 4.5.3 of [RFC9147] defines limits on the number of records q
   that can be protected using the same key as well as limits on the
   number of received packets v that fail authentication with each key.
   To adhere to these limits the DTLS Management Method can periodically
   poll the DTLS protection operation function to see when a limit have
   been reached or is closed to being reached.  Instead of periodic
   polling, a callback can be used.

13.3.  Downgrade Attacks

   Downgrade attacks may attempt to force the DTLS Management Method by
   altering the containt of INIT chunk, for instance by removing all
   offered DTLS Management Methods but the one desired.  This is
   possible if the attacker is an on-path attacker that can modify
   packet because INIT and INIT-ACK chunks are plain text.

   Preventing the downgrade attacks is implemented by using at the
   initiator the list of offered DTLS Management Method sent in the INIT
   chunk plus the selected DTLS Management Method received in the INIT-
   ACK chunk from the responder for deriving the keys from the
   handshaked secrets obtained during DTLS initial handshake.  At the
   responder, the list of offered DTLS Management Methods received in
   the INIT chunk plus the selected DTLS Management Method that is sent
   in the INIT-ACK chunk will be used for deriving the keys from the
   handshaked secrets obtained during DTLS initial handshake.

   If the attacker suceeds in changing the DTLS Management Methods in
   either INIT, NINT-ACK or both chunks, the peers will not be able
   deriving the same keys and the Association will not be possible to
   proceed.

   Thus, as long as the DTLS Management Method includes the ordered list
   of protection solutions indicators present in the parameter part of
   the INIT chunk for the SCTP Association in its key-derivation the
   association will be protected from down-grade.

   In case any DTLS Management Method do not include the parameter
   content in its key-derivation down-grade might be possible if that
   DTLS Management Method method is selected.  It is up to endpoint
   policies to determine which protection it deems necessary against
   down-grade attacks.

13.4.  Persistent Secure Storage of Restart Key Context

   The Restart DTLS Key Context needs to be stored securely and
   persistent.  Securely as access to this security context may enable
   an attacker to perform a restart, resulting a denial of service on
   the existing SCTP Association.  It can also give the attacker access
   to the ULP.  Thus the storage needs to provide at least as strong
   resistant against exfiltration as the main DTLS Key Context store.

   When it comes to how to realize persistent storage that is highly
   dependent on the ULP and how it can utilize restarted SCTP
   Associations.  One way can be to have an actual secure persistent
   storage solution accessible to the endpoint.  In other use cases the
   persistence part might be accomplished be keeping the current restart
   DTLS Key Context with the ULP State if that is sufficiently secure.
