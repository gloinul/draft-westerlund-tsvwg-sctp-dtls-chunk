--- abstract

This document describes a method for adding cryptographic protection
to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). The SCTP CRYPTO
chunk defined in this document is intended to enable communications
privacy for applications that use SCTP as their transport protocol and
allows applications to communicate in a way that is designed to
prevent eavesdropping and detect tampering or message forgery.

The CRYPTO chunk defined here in is one half of a complete
solution. Where a companion specification is required to define how
the content of the CRYPTO chunk is protected, authenticated, and
protected against replay, as well as how key management is
accomplished.

Applications using SCTP CRYPTO chunk can use all transport
features provided by SCTP and its extensions but with some limitations.

# Introduction {#introduction}

   This document defines a CRYPTO chunk for the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as defined in {{RFC9260}}.

   This specification defines the actual CRYPTO chunk. How to enable
   it usage, how it interacts with the SCTP association establishment
   to enable endpoint authentication, key-establishment, and other
   features require a separate protection engine specification.

   This specification is intended to be capable of enabling mutual
   authentication of endpoints, data confidentiality, data origin
   authentication, data integrity protection, and data replay
   protection for SCTP packets after the SCTP association has been
   established. The exact properties will depend on the companion
   specification defining the protection engine used with the CRYPTO
   chunk. The protection engine specification might be based on an
   existing security protocol.

   Applications using SCTP CRYPTO chunk can use most transport features
   provided by SCTP and its extensions. However, there can be some
   limitations or additional requirements for them to function such as
   those noted for SCTP restart and use of Dynamic Address
   Reconfiguration, see {{sec-asconf}} and {{sec-restart}}. Due to its
   level of integration as discussed in next section it will provide
   its security functions on all content of the SCTP packet, and will
   thus not impact the potential to utilize any SCTP functionalities
   or extensions that are possible to use between two SCTP peers with
   full security and SCTP association state.

# Overview

## Protocol Overview {#protocol-overview}

The CRYPTO chunk is defined as a method for secure and confidential
transfer for SCTP packets.  This is implemented inside the SCTP
protocol, in a sublayer between the SCTP common header handling and
the SCTP chunk handling.  Once an SCTP packet has been received and
the SCTP common header has been used to identify the SCTP association,
the CRYPTO chunk is sent to the chosen protection engine that will
return the SCTP payload containing the unprotected SCTP chunks, those
chunks will then be handled according to their SCTP protocol
specifications. {{sctp-Crypto-chunk-layering}} illustrates the CRYPTO
chunk layering in regard to SCTP and the Upper Layer Protocol (ULP).

{: #sctp-Crypto-chunk-layering title="CRYPTO Chunk Layering
in Regard to SCTP and ULP" artwork-align="center"}

Use of the CRYPTO chunk is defined per SCTP association and a SCTP
association uses a single protection engine. Different associations
within the same SCTP endpoint may use or not use the CRYPTO chunk, and
different associations may use different protection engines.

On the outgoing direction, once the SCTP stack has created the
unprotected SCTP packet payload containing control and/or DATA chunks,
that payload will be sent to the protection engine to be
protected. The format of the protected payload depends on the
protection engine but the unprotected payload will typically be
encrypted and integrity tagged before being encapsulated in a CRYPTO
chunk.

The SCTP protection engine performs protection operations on the whole
unprotected SCTP packet payload, i.e., all chunks after the SCTP
common header. Information protection is kept during the lifetime of
the association and no information is sent unprotected except than the
initial SCTP handshake, the SCTP common header, the SCTP CRYPTO chunk
header and the SHUTDOWN-COMPLETE chunk.

SCTP CRYPTO chunk capability is agreed by the peers at the
initialization of the SCTP association, during that phase the peers
exchange information about the protection engines available. Once the
SCTP association is established and the peers have agreed on what
protection to use, the SCTP endpoints may start sending Protection
Engine's payloads in SCTP DATA chunks containing the initialization
information related to the protection engine including key agreement
and endpoint authentication. This is depending on the chosen
protection engine thus is not being detailed in the current
specification and may be done out-of-band of the SCTP association.

When the endpoint authentication and key establishment has been
completed, the association is considered to be secured and the ULP is
informed about that. From this time on it's possible for the ULPs to
exchange data securely.

CRYPTO chunks will never be retransmitted, retransmission is
implemented by SCTP endpoint at chunk level as in the legacy.  Duplicated
CRYPTO chunks, whenever they will be accepted by the protection
engine, will result in duplicated SCTP chunks and will be handled as
duplicated chunks by SCTP endpoint in the same way a duplicated SCTP packet
with those SCTP chunks would have been.


## Protection Engines Considerations {#protection-engines}

The protection engine, independently from the security
characteristics, needs to be capable working on an unreliable
transport mechanism same as UDP in regards to the payloads of the
CRYPTO chunk, and have its own key management capability. SCTP is
capable of providing reliable transport of key-management messages.

SCTP CRYPTO chunk directly exploits the protection engine by
requesting protection and unprotection of a buffer, in particular the
protection buffer should never exceed the possible SCTP packet size
thus protection engine needs to be aware of the PMTU (see {{pmtu}}).

The key management part of the protection engine is the set of data
and procedures that take care of key distribution, verification, and
update. SCTP CRYPTO provides support for in-band key management, on
those cases the Protection Engines uses SCTP DATA chunks identified
with a dedicated Payload Protocol Identifier. The protection engine
can specify if the transmission of any key-managment messages are
non-reliable or reliable transmitted by SCTP.

During protection engine initialization, that is after the SCTP
association reaches the ESTABLISHED state (see {{RFC9260}} Section 4),
but before protection engine key-management has completed and the
Protected Assocation Parameter Validation is completed, the in-band
Key Management MAY use DATA chunks that SHALL use the Protection
Engine PPID (see {{iana-payload-protection-id}}). These DATA chunks
SHALL be sent unprotected by the protection engine as no keys have
been established yet. As soon as the protection engine has been
intialized and the validation has occured, any protection engine that
uses in-band key management, i.e. sent using SCTP DATA chunks with the
Protection Engine PPID, will have their message protected inside SCTP
CRYPTO chunk protected with the currently established key.
SCTP CRYPTO chunk state evolution is described in {{init-state-machine}}.

Key management MAY use other mechanism than what provided by SCTP CRYPTO
chunks, in any case the mechanism for key management MUST be detailed
in the specification for that protection engine.

The protection engines MAY exploit the Flags byte provided by the
CRYPTO chunk header (see {{sctp-Crypto-chunk-newchunk-crypt-struct}})
for its needs. Details of the use of Flags, if different from what
described in the current document, MUST be specified in the Protection
Engine Specification document for that specific protection engine.

The SCTP common header is assumed to be implicitly protected by the
protection engine. This protection is based on the assumption that
there will be a one-to-one mapping between SCTP association and
individually established security contexts. If the protection engine
does not meet that assumption further protection of the common header
is likely required.

An example of protection engine can be DTLS as specified in
{{I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-crypto-dtls}}.

## SCTP CRYPTO Chunk Buffering and Flow Control {#buffering}

Protection engine and SCTP are asynchronous, meaning that the
protection engine may deliver the decrypted SCTP Payload to the SCTP
endpoint without respecting the reception order.  It's up to SCTP
endpoint to reorder the chunks in the reception buffer and to take
care of the flow control according to what specified in
{{RFC9260}}. From SCTP perspective the CRYPTO chunk processing is part
of the transport network.

Even though the above allows the implementors to adopt a
multithreading design of the protection engines, the actual
implementation should consider that out-of-order handling of SCTP
chunks is not desired and may cause false congestions and
retransmissions.

## PMTU Considerations {#pmtu}

The addition of the CRYPTO chunk to SCTP reduces the room for payload,
due to the size of the CRYPTO chunk header and plain text expansion
due to ciphering algorithm and any authentication tag.  Thus, the SCTP
layer creating the plain text payload needs to know about the overhead
to adjust its target payload size appropriately.

On the other hand, the protection engine needs to be informed about
the PMTU by removing from the value the sum of the common SCTP header
and the CRYPTO chunk header. This implies that SCTP can propagate
the computed PMTU at run time specifically. The way protection engine
provides the primitive for PMTU communication shall be part of the
protection engine specification.

From SCTP perspective, if there is a maximum size of plain text data
that can be protected by the protection engine that must be
communicated to SCTP. As such a limit will limit the PMTU for SCTP to
the maximum plain text plus CRYPTO chunk and algorithm overhead plus
the SCTP common header.

## Congestion Control Considerations {#congestion}

The SCTP mechanism for handling congestion control does depend on
successful data transfer for enlarging or reducing the congestion
window CWND (see {{RFC9260}} Section 7.2).

It may happen that protection engine discards packets due to internal
checks or because it has detected a malicious attempt. As those
packets do not represent what the peer sent, it is acceptable to
ignore them, although in-situ modification on the path of a packet
resulting in discarding due to integrity failure will leave a gap, but
has to be accepted as part of the path behavior.

The protection engine shall not interfere with the SCTP congestion
control mechanism, this basically means that from SCTP perspective
the congestion control is exactly the same as how specified
in {{RFC9260}}.

## ICMP Considerations {#icmp}

The SCTP implementation will be responsible for handling ICMP messages
and their validation as specified in {{RFC9260}} Section 10. This
means that the ICMP validation needs to be done in relation to the
actual sent SCTP packets with the CRYPTO chunk and not the unprotected
payload. However, valid ICMP errors or information may indirectly be
provided to the protection engine, such as an update to PMTU values
based on packet to big ICMP messages.

## Path Selection Considerations {#multipath}

When an Association is multihomed there are multiple paths between Endpoints.
The selection of the specific path to be used at a certain time belongs
to SCTP protocol that will decide according to {{RFC9260}}.
The Protection Engine shall not influence the path selection algorithm,
actually the Protection Engine will not even know what path is being used.

## Dynamic Address Reconfiguration Considerations  {#sec-asconf}

When using Dynamic Address Reconfiguration {{RFC5061}} in an SCTP
association using CRYPTO Chunk the ASCONF chunk is protected, thus it
needs to be unprotected first, furthermore it MAY come from an unknown
IP Address.  In order to properly address the ASCONF chunk to the
relevant Association for being unprotected, Destination Address,
Source and Destination ports and VTag shall be exploited. If the
combination of those parameters is not unique the implementor MAY
choose to send the Crypto Chunk to all Associations that fit with the
parameters in order to find the right one. The association will
attempt de-protection operations on the crypto chunk, and if that is
successful the ASCONF chunk can be processed.

The recommendation {{RFC5061}} specifies (section 4.1.1 of
{{RFC5061}}) that ASCONF message are required to be sent authenticated
with SCTP-AUTH {{RFC4895}}. For SCTP associations using Crypto Chunks,
when the Protection Engine provides strong Authentication such for
instance in case of DTLS, results in the use of redundant mechanism
for Authentication with both SCTP-AUTH and the Crypto Chunk. We
recommend to amend {{RFC5061}} for including Crypto Chunks as
Authentication mechanism for ASCONF chunks.

## SCTP Restart Considerations  {#sec-restart}

This section deals with the handling of an unexpected INIT chunk during an
Association lifetime as described in {{RFC9260}} section 5.2 The introduction of
CRYPTO CHUNK opens for two alternatives depending on if the protection engine
preserves its state (crypto context) or not.

When the encryption engine can preserve the crypto context, meaning that
encrypted data belonging to the current Association can be encrypted and
decrypted, the request for SCTP Restart SHOULD use INIT chunk in CRYPTO chunk.

When the crypto context is not preserved, the SCTP Restart can only be
accomplished by means of plain text INIT.  This opens to a man-in-the-middle
attack where a malicious attacker may theoretically generate an INIT chunk with
proper parameters and hijack the SCTP association.

### INIT chunk in CRYPTO chunk

If the crypto context has been preserved the peer aiming for a SCTP Restart can
still send CRYPTO chunks that can be processed by the remote peer.  In such case
the peer willing to restart the Association SHOULD send the INIT chunk in a
CRYPTO chunk and encrypt it.  At reception of the CRYPTO chunk containing INIT,
the receiver will follow the procedure described in {{RFC9260}} section 5.2.2
with the exception that all the chunks will be sent in CRYPTO chunks.

An endpoint supporting SCTP Association Restart and implementing Crypto Chunk
MUST accept receiving SCTP packets with a verification tag with value 0.  The
endpoint will attempt to map the packet to an association based on source IP
address, destination address and port. If the combination of those parameters is
not unique the implementor MAY choose to send the Crypto Chunk to all
Associations that fit with the parameters in order to find the right one. Note
that type of trial decrypting of the SCTP packets will increase the resource
consumption per packet with the number of matching SCTP associations.

Note that the Association Restart will update the verification tags for both
endpoints.  At the end of the unexpected INIT handshaking the receiver of INIT
chunk SHALL trigger the creation of a new DTLS connection to be executed as soon
as possible to verify the peer identity.

### INIT chunk as plain text

If the crypto context isn't preserved the peer aiming for a SCTP Restart can
only perform an INIT in plain text. Supporting this option opens up the SCTP
association to an availability attack, where an capable attacker may be able to
hijack the SCTP association. Therefore an implementation should only support and
enable this option if restart is crucial.

To mount the attack the attacker needs to be able to process copies of packets
sent from the target endpoint towards its peer for the targeted SCTP
association. In addition the attacker needs to be able to send IP packets with
a source address of the target's peer. If the attacker can send an SCTP INIT
that appear to be from the peer, if the target is allowing this option it will
generate an INIT ACK back, and assuming the attacker succesfully completes the
restart handshake process the attack has managed to change the VTAG for the
association and the peer will no longer respond, leading to a SCTP associatons
failure.

As mitigation an SCTP endpoint supporting Association Restart by means of plain
text INIT SHOULD support is the following. The endpoint receiving an INIT
should send HEARTBEATs protected by CRYPTO CHUNK to its peer to validate that
the peer is unreachable. If the endpoint receive an HEARTBEAT ACK within a
reasonable time (at least a couple of RTTs) the restart INIT SHOULD be discarded
as the peer obviously can respond, and thus have no need for a restart. A
capable attacker can still succeed in its attack supressing the HEARTBEAT(s)
through packet filtering, congestion overload or any other method preventing the
HEARTBEATS or there ACKs to reach their destination. If it has been validated
that the peer is unreachable, the INIT chunk will trigger the procedure
described in {{RFC9260}} section 5.2.2

Note that the Association Restart will update the verification tags for both
endpoints.  At the end of the unexpected INIT handshaking the receiver of INIT
chunk SHALL trigger the creation of a new DTLS connection to be executed as soon
as possible.  Also note that failure in handshaking of a new DTLS connection is
considered a protocol violation and will lead to Association Abort (see
{{ekeyhandshake}}).

# New Parameter Type {#new-parameter-type}

This section defines the new parameter type that will be used to
negotiate the use of the CRYPTO chunk and protection engines during
association setup. {{sctp-Crypto-chunk-init-parameter}} illustrates
the new parameter type.

| Parameter Type | Parameter Name |
| 0x80xx | Protected Association |
{: #sctp-Crypto-chunk-init-parameter title="New INIT/INIT-ACK Parameter" cols="r l"}

Note that the parameter format requires the receiver to ignore the
parameter and continue processing if the parameter is not understood.
This is accomplished (as described in {{RFC9260}}, Section 3.2.1.)  by
the use of the upper bits of the parameter type.

## Protected Association Parameter {#protectedassoc-parameter}

This parameter is used to carry the list of proposed protection
engines and the chosen protection engine during INIT/INIT-ACK
handshake.

# Error Handling {#error_handling}

This specification introduces a new set of error causes that are to be
used when SCTP endpoint detects a faulty condition. The special case is
when the error is detected by the protection engine that may provide
additional information.

## Mandatory Protected Association Parameter Missing {#enoprotected}

When an initiator SCTP endpoint sends an INIT chunk that doesn't
contain the Protected Association parameter towards an SCTP endpoint
that only accepts protected associations, the responder endpoint SHALL
raise a Missing Mandatory Parameter error. The ERROR chunk will
contain the cause code 'Missing Mandatory Parameter' (2) (see
{{RFC9260}} Section 3.3.10.7) and the protected association parameter
identifier {{protectedassoc-parameter}} in the missing param
Information field.

## Error in Protection {#eprotect}

A new Error Type is defined for Crypto Chunk, it's used for any
error related to the Protection mechanism described in this
document and has a structure that allows detailed information
to be added as extra causes.

This specification describes some of the causes whilst the
Protection Engine Specification MAY add further Causes related to the
related Protection Engine.

When detecting an error, SCTP will send an ABORT chunk containing
the relevant Error Type and Causes.

Editor's Note: Please replace TBA9 above with what is assigned by IANA.

Below a number of defined Error Causes are defined, additional causes
can be registered with IANA following the rules in {{IANA-Extra-Cause}}.

### No Supported Protection Engine {#eprotlist}

If list of protection engines contained in the INIT signal doesn't
contain at least an entry that fits the list of protection engines at
the responder, the responder will reply with an ABORT chunk with error
in protection cause code (specified in
{{eprotect}}) and the "No Supported Protection
Engine" extra cause code identifier 0x00.

### Error During Protection Handshake {#ekeyhandshake}

If the protection engine specifies a handshake for example for
authentication, and key management is implemented in-band, it may happen
that the procedure has errors. In such case an ABORT chunk will be
sent with error in protection cause code (specified in
{{eprotect}}) and extra cause
"Error During Protection Handshake" identifier 0x01.

### Failure in Protection Engines Validation {#evalidate}

A Failure may occur during protection engine Validation, i.e. when the
PVALID chunks {{pvalid-chunk}} are exchanged to validate the protection
engine offered. In such case an ABORT chunk will be sent with error
in protection cause code (specified in {{eprotect}}) and extra cause
"Failure in Protection Engines Validation" identifier 0x02 to indicate
this failure.

### Timeout During Protection Handshake or Validation {#etmout}

Whenever a T-valid timeout occurs, the SCTP endpoint will send an
ABORT chunk with "Error in Protection" cause (specified in
{{eprotect}}) and extra cause "Timeout During
Protection Handshake or Validation" identifier 0x03 to indicate this
failure.  To indicate in which phase the timeout occurred an additional
extra cause code is added. If the protection engine specifies that key
management is implemented in-band and the T-valid timeout occurs during
the handshake the Cause-Specific code to add is "Error During
Protection Handshake" identifier 0x01.  If the T-valid timeout occurs
during the protection association parameter validation, the extra
cause code to use is "Failure in Protection Engines Validation"
identifier 0x02.

## Critical Error from Protection Engine {#eengine}

Protection engine MAY inform local SCTP endpoint about errors, in such
case it's to be defined in the protection engine specification
document.  When an Error in the protection engine compromises the
protection mechanism, the protection engine may stop processing data
altogether, thus the local SCTP endpoint will not be able to send or
receive any chunk for the specified Association.  This will cause the
Association to be closed by legacy timer-based mechanism. Since the
Association protection is compromised no further data will be sent and
the remote peer will also experience timeout on the Association.

## Non-critical Error in the Protection Engine {#non-critical-errors}

A non-critical error in the protection engine means that the
protection engine is capable of recovering without the need
of the whole Association to be restarted.

From SCTP perspective, a non-critical error will be perceived
as a temporary problem in the transport and will be handled
with retransmissions and SACKS according to {{RFC9260}}.

When the protection engine will experience a non-critical error,
an ABORT chunk SHALL NOT be sent. This way non-critical errors
are handled and how the protection engine will recover from
these errors is being described in the Protection Engine Specifications.

# Procedures {#procedures}

## Establishment of a Protected Association {#establishment-procedure}

An SCTP Endpoint acting as initiator willing to create a protected
association shall send to the remote peer an INIT chunk containing the
Protected Association parameter (see {{protectedassoc-parameter}})
where all the supported Protection Engines are listed, given in
descending order of preference (see
{{sctp-Crypto-chunk-init-options}}).

An SCTP Endpoint acting as responder, when receiving an INIT chunk
with protected association parameter, will search the list of
protection engines for the most preferred commonly supported choice
and will reply with INIT-ACK containing the protected association
parameter with the chosen protection engine. When the responder cannot
find a supported protection engine, it will reply with ABORT
containing Error in Protection with the extra cause code for "No
Supported Protection Engine" ({{eprotlist}}).

Additionally, an SCTP Endpoint acting as responder willing to
support only protected associations shall consider INIT chunk not
containing the Protected Association parameter as an error, thus it
will reply with an ABORT chunk according to what specified in
{{enoprotected}} indicating that for this endpoint mandatory protected
association parameter is missing.

When initiator and responder have agreed on a protected association by
means of handshaking INIT/INIT-ACK with a common protection engine the
SCTP association establishment continue until it has reached the
ESTABLISHED state. However, before the SCTP assocation is protected by
the Crypto Chunk and its protection engine some additional states
needs to be passed. First the protection engine needs be initilizied
in the PROTECTION INTILIZATION state. When that has been accomplished
one enters the VALIDATION state where one validates the exchange of
the Protected Association Parameter. If that is successful one enters
the PROTECTED state. This state sequence is depicted in
{{init-state-machine}}.

Until the procedure has reached the PROTECTED state the only usage
of DATA Chunks that is accepted is DATA Chunks with the Protection
Engine PPID. Any other DATA chunk being sent on a Protected
association SHALL be silently discarded.

The Protection Engine may initialize itself by transferring its own
messages as payload of the DATA chunk if necessary. The Crypto Chunk
initialization SHOULD be supervised by a T-valid timer that depends on
the protection engine and may also be further adjusted based on whether
expected RTT values are outside of the ones commonly occurring on the
general Internet, see {{t-valid-considerations}}. At completion of
Protection Engine initialization the setup of the Protected
association is complete and one enters the VALIDATION state, and from
that time on only CRYPTO chunks will be exchanged. Any plain text
chunk will be silently discarded.

If protection engine key establishment is in-band, the protection
engine will start the handshake with its peer and in case of failure
or T-valid timeout, the endpoint will generate an ABORT chunk.
The ERROR handling follows what specified in {{ekeyhandshake}}.

The protection engine specification MUST specify when VALIDATION state
can be entered for each endpoint. If key establishment is out-of-band,
after starting T-valid timer the SCTP association will enter the
VALIDATION state per protection engine specification when the
necessary security context is in place.

When entering the VALIDATION state, the initiator MUST send to the
responder a PVALID chunk (see
{{sctp-Crypto-chunk-newchunk-pvalid-chunk}}) containing the list of
Protection Engines previously sent in the protected association
parameter of the INIT chunk. The transmission of the PVALID chunk MUST
be done reliably. The responder receiving the PVALID chunk will
compare the Protection Engines list with the one previously received
in the INIT chunk, if they are exactly the same, with the same
Protection engine in the same position, it will reply to the initiator
with a PVALID chunk containing the chosen Protection Engine, otherwise
it will reply with an ABORT chunk. ERROR CAUSE will indicate "Failure
in Protection Engines Validation" and the SCTP association will be
terminated. If the association was not aborted the protected
association is considered successfully established and the PROTECTED
state is entered.

When the initiator receives the PVALID chunk, it will compare with the
previous chosen Protection Engine and in case of mismatch with the one
received previously in the protected association parameter in the
INIT-ACK chunk, it will reply with ABORT with the ERROR CAUSE "Failure
in Protection Engines Validation", otherwise the protected association
is successfully established and the initiator enters the PROTECTED
state.

If T-valid timer expires either at initiator or responder, it will generate
an ABORT chunk.  The ERROR handling follows what
specified in {{etmout}}.

In the PROTECTED state any ULP SCTP messages for any PPID MAY be
exchanged in the protected SCTP association.

## Termination of a Protected Association {#termination-procedure}

Besides the procedures for terminating an association explained in
{{RFC9260}}, the protection engine SHALL ask SCTP endpoint for
terminating an association when having an internal error or by
detecting a security violation, using the procedure described
in {{eengine}}.
During the termination procedure all Control Chunks SHALL be protected
except SHUTDOWN-COMPLETE. The internal design of Protection
Engines and their capability is out of the scope of the current
document.

## Considerations on Key Management {#key-management-considerations}

When the Association is in PROTECTION INITILIZATION state, in-band key
management shall exploit SCTP DATA chunk with the Protection Engine
PPID (see {{iana-payload-protection-id}}) that will be sent
unencrypted.

When the Association is in crypto chunk PROTECTED state and the SCTP
assocation is in ESTABLISHED or any of the states that can be reached
after ESTABLISHED state, in-band key management shall exploit SCTP
DATA chunk that will be protected by the Protection Engine and
encapsulated in CRYPTO chunks.

In-band key management shall use a dedicated Payload Protocol
Identifier assigned by IANA and defined in the specific Protection
Engine Specification.

## Consideration on T-valid {#t-valid-considerations}

The timer T-Valid supervises initializations that depend on how
the handshake is specified for the Protection Engine and also on
the characteristics of the transport network.

This specification recommends a default value of 30 seconds for
T-valid. This value is expected to be superseded by recommendations in
the Protection Engine Specification for each Protection Engine.

# Protected Data Chunk Handling {#protected-data-handling}

With reference to the Crypto Chunk states and the state Diagram as
shown in Figure 3 of {{RFC9260}}, the handling of Control chunks, Data
chunks and Crypto chunks follows the rules defined below:

- When the association is in states CLOSED, COOKIE-WAIT, and
COOKIE-ECHOED, any Control chunk is sent unprotected (i.e. plain
text). No DATA chunks shall be sent in these states and DATA chunks
received shall be silently discarded.

- When the Crypto Chunk is in state PROTECTED and the SCTP association
is in states ESTABLISHED or in the states for association shutdown,
i.e. SHUTDOWN-PENDING, SHUTDOWN-SENT, SHUTDOWN-RECEIVED,
SHUTDOWN-ACK-SENT as defined by {{RFC9260}}, any SCTP chunk including
DATA chunks, but excluding CRYPTO chunk, will be used to create an
SCTP payload that will be encrypted by the Protection Engine and the
result from that encryption will be the used as payload for a CRYPTO
chunk that will be the only chunk in the SCTP packet to be sent. DATA
chunks are accepted and handled according to section 4 of {{RFC9260}}.

{: #sctp-Crypto-encrypt-chunk-states-2 title="Protected SCTP Packets" artwork-align="center"}

The diagram shown in {{sctp-Crypto-encrypt-chunk-states-2}} describes
the structure of an SCTP packet being sent after the Crypto Chunk
VALIDATION or PROTECTED state has been reached. Such packets are built
with the SCTP common header. Only one CRYPTO chunk can be sent in
a SCTP packet.

## Protected Data Chunk Transmission {#data-sending}

When the Crypto Chunk state machine hasn't reached the VALIDATION state, the
protection enigne MAY perform protection engine key management in-band
depending on how the specification for the chosen Protection Engine
has been defined.  In such case, the CRYPTO chunk Handler will receive
plain control and DATA chunks from the SCTP chunk handler.

When the Crypto Chunk has reached the VALIDATION and PROTECTED state,
the CRYPTO chunk handler will receive control chunks and DATA chunks
from the SCTP chunk handler as a complete SCTP payload with maximum
size limited by PMTU reduced by the size of the SCTP common header and
the CRYPTO chunk overhead.

That plain payload will be sent to the protection engine in use for
that specific association, the protection engine will return an
encrypted payload.

Depending on the specification for the chosen protection engine, when
forming the CRYPTO chunk header the CRYPTO chunk handler MAY set the
chunk header flags (see {{sctp-Crypto-chunk-newchunk-crypt-struct}}).

An SCTP packet containing an SCTP CRYPTO chunk SHALL be delivered
without delay and SCTP bundling SHALL NOT be performed.

## Protected Data Chunk Reception {#data-receiving}

When the Crypto Chunk state machine hasn't reached the VALIDATION
state, it MAY handle key management in-band depending on how the
specification for the chosen protection engine has been defined.  In
such case, the CRYPTO chunk handler will receive plain control chunks
and DATA chunks with Protection Engine PPID from the SCTP Header
Handler. Those plain control chunks will be forwarded to SCTP chunk
handler.

When the Crypto Chunk state machine has reached the VALIDATION or
PROTECTED state, the CRYPTO chunk handler will receive CRYPTO chunks
from the SCTP Header Handler.  Payload from CRYPTO chunks will be
forwarded to the protection engine in use for that specific
association for decryption, the protection engine will return a plain
SCTP Payload.  The plain SCTP payload will be forwarded to SCTP Chunk
Handler that will split it in separated chunks and will handle them
according to {{RFC9260}}.

Depending on the specification for the chosen protection engine, when
receiving the CRYPTO chunk header the CRYPTO Chunk Handler MAY handle
the Flags (see {{sctp-Crypto-chunk-newchunk-crypt-struct}}) according
to that specification.

Meta data belonging to the SCTP packet received SHALL be tied to the
relevant chunks and forwarded transparently to the SCTP endpoint.

### SCTP Header Handler

The SCTP Header Handler is responsible for correctness of the SCTP
common header, it receives the SCTP packet from the lower transport
layer, discriminates among associations and forwards the payload and
relevant data to the SCTP protection engine for handling.

In the opposite direction it creates the SCTP common header and fills
it with the relevant information for the specific association and
delivers it towards the lower transport layer.


# IANA Considerations {#IANA-Consideration}

This document defines two new registries in the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Parameters group that IANA
maintains. Theses registries are for the protection engine identifiers
and extra cause codes for protection related errors. It also adds
registry entries into several other registries in the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Parameters group:

*  Two new SCTP Chunk Types

*  One new SCTP Chunk Parameter Type

*  One new SCTP Error Cause Codes

*  One new SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier

## Protection Engine Identifier Registry {#iana-protection-engines}

IANA is requested to create a new registry called "CRYPTO Chunk
Protection Engine Identifiers". This registry is part of the Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Parameters grouping.

The purpose of this registry is to enable identification of different
protection engines used by the CRYPTO chunk when performing the SCTP
handshake and negotiating support. Entries in the registry requires a
protection engine name, a reference to the specification for the
protection engine, and a contact. Each entry will be assigned by IANA
a unique 16-bit unsigned integer identifier for their protection
engine. Values 0-65534 are available for assignment. Value 65535 is
reserved for future extension. The proposed general form of the
registry is depicted below in {{iana-protection-engine-identifier}}.

## Protection Error Cause Codes Registry {#IANA-Extra-Cause}

IANA is requested to create a new registry called "Protection Error
Cause Codes". This registry is part of the Stream Control Transmission
Protocol (SCTP) Parameters grouping.

The purpose of this registry is to enable identification of different
protection related errors when using CRYPTO chunk and a protection
engine.  Entries in the registry requires a Meaning, a reference to
the specification defining the error, and a contact. Each entry will
be assigned by IANA a unique 16-bit unsigned integer identifier for
their protection engine. Values 0-65534 are available for
assignment. Value 65535 is reserved for future extension. The proposed
general form of the registry is depicted below in

# Security Considerations {#Security-Considerations}

All the security and privacy considerations of the security protocol
used as the protection engine applies.

## Privacy Considerations

Using a security protocol in the SCTP CRYPTO chunk might lower the
privacy properties of the security protocol as the SCTP Verification
Tag is an unique identifier for the association.

## Downgrade Attacks {#Downgrade-Attacks}

The CRYPTO chunk provides a mechanism for preventing downgrade attacks
that detects downgrading attempts between protection engines and
terminates the association. The chosen protection engine is the same
as if the peers had been communicating in the absence of an attacker.

The protection engine initial handshake is verified before the
Crypto Chunk is considered protected, thus no user data are sent before
validation.

The downgrade protection is only as strong as the weakest of the
supported protection engines as an active attacker can trick the
endpoints to negotiate the weakest protection engine and then
modify the weakly protected CRYPTO chunks to deceive the endpoints
that the negotiation of the protection engines is validated. This
is similar to the downgrade protection in TLS 1.3 specified in
Section 4.1.3. of {{RFC8446}} where downgrade protection is not
provided when TLS 1.2 with static RSA is used. It is RECOMMENDED
to only support a limited set of strongly profiled protection
engines.

# Requirements Towards the Protection Engines {#requirements}

This section specifies what is to be specified in the description
of a protection engine.

 * Define how to protect the plain text set of chunks and encapsulate
   them in the CRYPTO Chunk payload.

 * Can define its usage of the 8-bit chunk Flags field in the CRYPTO
   chunk

 * Is required to register the defined protection engine(s) with IANA
   per {{iana-protection-engines}}.

 * Detail the state transition between PROTECTION INITILIZATION and
   VALIDATION.
